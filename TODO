#Rewrite the user specs to use factory stubs
#if the solution does not compile, then should that not be part of the unit test object, not the job object
#The grade sheet specs are all fucked, rewrite using factory specs

Write grade solution specs 

Get rid of the SyntaxChecker, use the Compile class instead

In unit_test and Compiler, consolidate the file manipulation stuff, to an external class
	that is responsible for generating unique file names.
	
The template class should not be responsibile for compiling it self or checking it self forsyntax errors. 
	Instead have the unit-test class be responsible for compiling the solution template and checking for syntax errors
	
The unit_test#run_on method doesn't need the entire template. Instead it just needs the filled in template code

#add error message to the return result

Don't run raw commands using `` instead move into some object
 so that I can change the way this stuff runs on heroku

Get rid of the string literals in UnitTestSpec

Implement the following convention for UnitTest.run_on
	- results = {:error=>[a standard list of errors], 
							 ? :error_message=>"A description of the error", ?
							 :grade=>[the grade], 
							 :tests=>{:unit_test_name=>:points}
							 :run_times=>{:linear_size=>[size1, size2, ...],
														:linear_time=>[time1, time2, ...]
														}
							}
							
Should GradeSolutionResult and SyntaxCheckResult be consolidated somehow?

The rescue's should log the exceptions
