#Rewrite the user specs to use factory stubs

Write grade solution specs 

if the solution does not compile, then should that not be part of the unit test object, not the job object

#The grade sheet specs are all fucked, rewrite using factory specs

Get rid of the SyntaxChecker, use the Compile class instead

In unit_test and Compiler, consolidate the file manipulation stuff, to an external class
	that is responsible for generating unique file names.
	
The template class should not be responsibile for compiling it self or checking it self forsyntax errors. 
	Instead have the unit-test class be responsible for compiling the solution template and checking for syntax errors
	
The unit_test#run_on method doesn't need the entire template. Instead it just needs the filled in template code



Don't run raw commands using `` instead move into some object
 so that I can change the way this stuff runs on heroku
