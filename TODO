#Rewrite the user specs to use factory stubs
#if the solution does not compile, then should that not be part of the unit test object, not the job object
#The grade sheet specs are all fucked, rewrite using factory specs
#add error message to the return result (*done but instead I added a different method that returns the error)
#Write grade solution specs 
#Get rid of the SyntaxChecker, use the Compile class instead
#In unit_test and Compiler, consolidate the file manipulation stuff, to an external class
#	that is responsible for generating unique file names.
#The template class should not be responsibile for compiling it self or checking it self forsyntax errors. 
#	Instead have the unit-test class be responsible for compiling the solution template and checking for syntax errors
#The unit_test#run_on method doesn't need the entire template. Instead it just needs the filled in template code
#Add the exercise prototypes and handle the unit tests and syntax checks
#Unit tests and executables should communicate through stdin and pipes
#Fix the unit test grade sheet it is not returning the correct results

Add a basic 'conectivity' scenario for grading, and then one to test every exercise

Finish the first exercise. Create the timing test, have it return a real grade, ...

Write a unit test frame work so that there is no duplication between unit tests

Add a limit to the amount of times the client will poll for results

The rescue's should log the exceptions

Make compiler use pipes instead of files to use the compiler


Don't run raw commands using `` instead move into some object
 so that I can change the way this stuff runs on heroku

Get rid of the string literals in UnitTestSpec

Implement the following convention for UnitTest.run_on
	- results = {:error=>[a standard list of errors], 
							 ? :error_message=>"A description of the error", ?
							 :grade=>[the grade], 
							 :tests=>{:unit_test_name=>:points}
							 :run_times=>{:linear_size=>[size1, size2, ...],
														:linear_time=>[time1, time2, ...]
														}
							}
							
Should GradeSolutionResult and SyntaxCheckResult be consolidated somehow?
