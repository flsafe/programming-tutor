<p>
Write a function that takes as an argument a head pointer to a
linked list and prints the linked list in
reverse order. The linked list a singly linked list with no tail pointer. Each node
of the linked list contains a <i>char</i> value type. 
</p>

<p>
For example, if the linked list contains the characters:
<p>

[startcode]
"a" -> "b" -> "c" -> "d"
[endcode]

<p>
Then the function prints out the string:
</p>

[startcode]
  dcba
[endcode]

<p>
to standard output. Notice that the output is all on one line.
</p>

<p>
You can use <i>printf("%c", a_char)</i> to print to a character standard output.
You can use <i>printf("%s", a_string)</i> to print to a string standard output.
</p>
