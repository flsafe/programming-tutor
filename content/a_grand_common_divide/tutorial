Right away the problem description gives away how to find a 
solution. Find the largest number that divides both arguments
evenly. We'll go over the obvious way to solve this exercise first. 
Then the genius way.

<h1 id="how-to-solve">The First Obvious Way</h1>
<p>
The initial algorithm is straight forward so let's just
look at the code.
</p>

[startcode]
  [[solution1.c]]
[endcode]

<p>
The code starts with testing for special cases. The 
problem text says we should define <i>gcd(0, 0)</i> as
0, so that's what we test for first. 
</p>

<p>
The next special case to consider is when <i>a</i> is zero
and <i>b</i> is non-zero or vice-versa. Since all numbers divide into zero evenly 
we just use the non-zero argument as the greatest common divisor of the two arguments.
</p>

<p>
Next comes the meat of our algorithm. The overall strategy is to test the
integers below <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> and find which integer,
<i>i</i>, divides into both evenly. Initially <i>i = min(a,b)</i> and in a loop
we test <i>i</i> until <i>i</i> is &lt;= 1 or we find the <i>i</i>
that divides <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>.
