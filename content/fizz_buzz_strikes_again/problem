<p>
Write a function that prints out the numbers between 1 and 100 inclusive 
in the following manner:
</p>

<p>
If a number is a multiple of 3 then print "fizz" instead of the number. If
the the number is a multiple of 5 then print "buzz" instead of the number. If
the number is a multiple of both three and five then print "fizzbuzz" instead
of the number. 
</p>

<p> For example: </p>

<pre><code>
1
2
fizz
4
buzz
fizz
7
8
fizz
buzz
11
fizz
13
14
fizzbuzz
</code></pre>

<p>
Notice that each number is printed on its own line and there are no empty lines. 
The words "fizz" and "buzz" are lowercase and the word "fizzbuzz" has
no space in between. Good luck!
</p>
