<h4>Hint 1:</h4>
<p>The obvious but naive solution is the following algorithm:</p>

<pre><code>
for each letter L in str
 if remove L
  shift everything to the right of L to the left by one
</code></pre>

<p>
This is very inefficient and is O(n^2) in the worst case. You can do better!
</p>

<p>
In fact this problem can be solved with a linear runtime algorithm.
