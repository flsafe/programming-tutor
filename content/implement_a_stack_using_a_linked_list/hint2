Here is a pseudo code description
of inserting an element into the front 
of a linked list. 
</p>

<pre><code>
function insert(HEAD, V)
  allocate a new element N
  set N.val to V
  set N.next to HEAD
  set HEAD to N

function remove(HEAD)
  set TMP to HEAD
  set HEAD to HEAD.next
  deallocate TMP
</pre></code>

<p>
Okay, okay, the code above describes the
general concept but the devil is in 
the details! It has to do with the scope
of local variables and passing function
arguments by value.
</p>

<p>
In other words HEAD might be updated inside
our pseudo code functions. But what
happens to HEAD when our function returns?
Don't all our local variables disappear 
when the function returns?
</p>

<p>
Yes they do...
</p>
<p>
But the gist is right. Does this hint help?
