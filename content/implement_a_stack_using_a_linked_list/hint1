<p>
   We want an efficient implementation
   for the <i>pop</i> and <i>push</i> operations.
   If we append new elements to the end of 
   the linked list then, <i>push</i> and <i>pop</i>
   get slower as the list grows.
</p>

<p>
  Therefore make sure you pre-append new elements to
  the front of the linked list! This will make
  the <i>push</i> and <i>pop</i> operations take
  the same amount of steps now matter how large the
  linked list is!
</p>

<p>
  Next is the actual linked list insertion and
  deletion into a linked list. How do you insert/remove an element
  from the front of a linked list?
