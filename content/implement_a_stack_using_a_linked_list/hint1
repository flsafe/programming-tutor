   We want an efficient implementation
   for the <i>pop</i> and <i>push</i> operations.
   If we append new elements to the end of 
   the linked list the, our operations
   will get slower based on how many elements
   are in the list.

<p>
  Pre-appending to the front is the
  more efficient choice since there
  is no need to traverse to the end
  of the list before inserting or deleting
  and element. 
</p>

<p>
  The problem then is really a linked list
  problem. How do you insert/remove an element
  from the front of a linked list?
