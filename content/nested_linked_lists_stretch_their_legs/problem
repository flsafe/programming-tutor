<p>
  Implement a stack data structure. Use a linked list to implement the <i>push</i>
  and <i>pop</i> operations.
</p>

<p>
  Here is the specification:
</p>

<pre><code>
int pop(stack **s, int* val)

 - Removes the element at 
   the top of the stack.

 - s is a pointer to the
   head pointer of the linked list.

 - val is an integer pointer were
   the poped data value will be stored.

 - Returns 1 if the pop operation
   was successful, otherwise
   returns 0.

 - Return 0 if the pop operation 
   is on an empty stack.

int push(stack **s, int v)

  - Inserts a new element
    at the top of the stack.

  - s is a pointer to the head
    pointer of the linked list.

  - v is the value to insert.

  - Returns 1 if the operation was
    successful, otherwise returns 0.
