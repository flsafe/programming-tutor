<p>
Write a function that takes two arguments. The first argument is a char 'c'. The second is a
char array 'str'. The function deletes all instances of 'c' in 'str'.
</p>

<p> For example: </p>

<pre><code>
remove_char('c', 'acacac') => 'aaa'

remove_char('c', 'aaaac')  => 'aaaa'
	
remove_char('c', 'abab')   => 'abab'
</code></pre>

<p>
Notice that the function 'remove_char' returns
'void' and modifies the 'str' input array in place.
</p>

<h4>Hint 1:</h4>
<p> Most people on their first try come up with an algorithm like this:</p>

<pre><code>
for each letter L in str
 if L equals C
  shift everything to the right of L to the left by one
</code></pre>

<p>
This is very inefficient and is O(n^2) in the worst case. You can do better!
</p>

<p>
In fact how could you do this in linear time?
