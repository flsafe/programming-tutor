Have you ever used a string replace function?
Or a string replace in your favorite programming language? Lets write a simple version of that
function to get warmed up.
</p>

<p>
Consider a function that takes two arguments. The first argument is a char 'c'. The second is a
char array 'str'. The function we are trying to write deletes all instances of 'c' in 'str'.
</p>

<p>For example:</p>
<pre>
	<b>Function Prototype:</b>
	void remove_char(char, str);

	<b>Example input/output:</b>
	remove_char('c', 'acacac') => 'aaa'

	remove_char('c', 'aaaac')  => 'aaaa'
	
	remove_char('c', 'abab')   => 'abab'
</pre>

<p>
Not too bad eh? Well here is an extra constraint: The function 'remove_char' returns
'void'. So your function must modify its second parameter 'str'. Good luck!
</p>


Hint 1:
<p> Most people on their first try come up with an algorithm like this:</p>
	  <pre>
		for each letter L in str
			if L equals C
				shift everything to the right of L to the left by one
		</pre>
<p>
	This is very inefficient and is O(n^2) in the worst case. You can do better! 
	In fact how could you do this in linear time?
</p>
	
	
Hint 2:
	<p>
	Okay you say, how do I do it in linear time? Well... that's the subject
	of the tutorial at the end of the exercise! But here is a hint:
	</p>
	
		<p>Lets say you could allocate another array. Then the algorithm would be something like:</p>
		<pre>
			allocate array str_new
			
			for each letter L in str
				if L is not equal to C
					copy L into str_new
		</pre>
		
		<p>			
		Believe it or not you could do the same thing with only 'str'. In other words,
		you can design an algorithm like the one above were 'str_new' is actually
		just 'str'. No need for another array!
		Can you figure out how?
