Have you ever used a string replace function?
Or a string replace in your favorite programming language? Lets write a simple version of that
function to get warmed up.
</p>

<p>
Consider a function that takes two arguments. The first argument is a char 'c'. The second is a
char array 'str'. The function we are trying to write deletes all instances of 'c' in 'str'.
</p>

<h4>For example:</h4>

<h5>Function Prototype:</h5>
<code>void remove_char(char,str);</code>

<h5>Example input/output:</h5>
<code>
remove_char('c', 'acacac') => 'aaa'

remove_char('c', 'aaaac')  => 'aaaa'
	
remove_char('c', 'abab')   => 'abab'
</code>


<p>
Not too bad eh? Well here is an extra constraint: The function 'remove_char' returns
'void'. So your function must modify its second parameter 'str'. Good luck!
</p>



<h4>Hint 1:</h4>
<p> Most people on their first try come up with an algorithm like this:</p>

<code>
<pre>
for each letter L in str
 if L equals C
  shift everything to the right of L to the left by one
</pre>
</code>

<p>
This is very inefficient and is O(n^2) in the worst case. You can do better!
</p>

<p>
In fact how could you do this in linear time?
