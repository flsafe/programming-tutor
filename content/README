The content/push script will push exercises to the DB
using the development environment as default. You can change
the environment with the command 'env RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec ruby content/push'.


--- Text processing done before pushing to database

  - The push script supports some text processing before the exercise text is sent to the server.
    Here are some things you can use.

     [[filename.txt]]  - This tag is replaced with the file filename.txt. The file name
                         is relative to the exercise directory.

     [startcode] [endcode] - Everything between these two tags are wrapped with <pre><code> </code></pre>
                             and the < characters are excaped with &lt;

     These tags can be nested for example:

     [startcode]
       [[solution.c]]
     [endcode]


--- Text that has special meaning when Blueberry is running

   - Solution template files have a special comment that is used to identify the
     the desired prototype for the user to use when coding thier solution.

     /*start_prototype*/ /*end_prototype*/ - The code between these two comments is displayed in the text editor
                                             when the user starts and exercise. Only one per file is supported

-- Exercise/Set maintenance 

  - Exercise sets are described in content/exercise-sets.yml. 
    This file is used to the push script to determine what exercises belong to what sets,
    and to update/delete exercises and sets.

  - To rename and exercise rename the exercise directory and the exercise name in exercise-sets.yml
  - To delete an exercise remove the exercise directory and remove the exercise name in the
    exercise-sets.yml file

  - To rename an exercise set rename the exercise set in exercise-sets.yml
  - To delete and exercise set, remove the exercise set from exercise-sets.yml and
    remove the exercise directories.
