== Welcome to Blueberry
	Blueberry is the web app that will help you land your next job interview! Blueberry will
	give you programming interview exercises that you can practice with. It will grade your solutions
	and assess your skills and guide you through ever more challenging programming exercises.


== Getting Started
	Blueberry uses bundler to manage the gem dependencies
	
	Type './install_prereqs' to install system dependencies (Script uses yum, modify to use other package manager)
	Type 'bundle install' to install all the gem dependencies
   *Note: On Fedora you may see the message '0 bad file descriptor'. I had some luck going into the
          directory '~/.bundle/ruby/1.8/gems/ffi-0.6.3/ext/ffi_c/libffi' and 
          typing './configure; make ; cd .. ; make'.					 
    Then runing 'bundle install' at the project root again.

   *Note: The install script above run 'lein deps' but it throws an exception. 
          If you move into the recomendation-engine directory and type 'lein deps'
					manually, then it seem to install the dependencies.
   *Note: If the server isn't responsive, try running 'lein repl'. This will
          copy the deps to the project and the server may startup.


  Create the mysql accounts in config/database.yml
  Type 'rake db:migrate'
  Type 'rake db:test:prepare'

	Type 'script/server' to start the server
	Go to 'localhost:3000' to start the app

	Register your account by going to the 'register' link
	You are now registered! But you need admin access.
	Type: 'scrip/console' to bring up the ROR console
	Type: 'u = User.first'
	Type: 'u.add_role('admin')'
	Type: 'u.save'
  You now are an admin and should have access to the admin panel!

  Type 'script/delayed_job start' to start the jobs for grading and syntax checks
  Type 'recomendation-engine/start' to start the recomendation server
  Type 'content/push' to add exercises in content/ to the db
