== Welcome to Blueberry
	Blueberry is the web app that will help you land your next job interview! Blueberry will
	give you programming interview exercises that you can practice with. It will grade your solutions
	and assess your skills and guide you through ever more challenging programming exercises.


== Getting Started
	Blueberry uses bundler to manage the gem dependencies
	
	1. Type 'bundle install' to install all the gem dependencies
	2. Type 'script/server' to start the server
	3. Go to 'localhost:3000' to start the app
	4. Register your account by going to the 'register' link
	5. You are now registered! But you need admin access.
	6. Type: 'scrip/console' to bring up the ROR console
	7. Type: 'u = User.first'
	8. Type: 'u.add_role('admin')'
	9. Type: 'u.save'
